## [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/AbhijitGokhale/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detetction)
Utilize existing credit card fraud data from January 2019 to December 2020 and develop a machine learning model in PySpark to perform Big Data Analysis which inturn leads to the best prediction results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions.
* **PySpark Libraries used:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, pyspark.sql, spark.ml
* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, seaborn, plotly
* **Input:** 1.8 Million rows consisting Financial and Demographic Information
* **Output:** Fraudulent and Legitimate Credit Card Transaction Classification with a probability giving optimized F-1 Score

## [Statistical & Predictive Analysis - Vaccination Rates in Californian School Districts](https://github.com/AbhijitGokhale/Statistical-Analysis-on-California-School-Districts-Vaccination)
The project explains specific and appropriate statistical values; both frequentist and Bayesian inferential evidence; explanation including both data exploration and cleaning and appropriate diagnostics.
* **R Libraries:** tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, psych, dlookr, tseries, car, DHARMa, lm.beta, BayesFactor, performance, caret, MCMCpack
* **Input:** RData file contains two data sets that pertain to vaccinations for the U.S. as a whole and for Californian school districts. The U.S. vaccine data is a time series, and the California data is a sample of end-of-year vaccination reports from n=700 school districts.
* **Output:** Necessary statistical analysis of vaccination rates in California school districts.

## [Covid-19 Patient's Pre-Condition Analysis](https://github.com/AbhijitGokhale/Covid-19-Patient-s-Pre-Condition-Analysis)
Analyze the factors that influence mortality in patients who do not need an intensive care unit and those who do. What are the underlying comorbidities that patients are likely to test positive for COVID? Which factors influence the need for an intensive care unit? This can help with patient triage, optimal distribution of vaccinations (if needed) in countries with limited resources, or prevention in countries susceptible to the virus.
* **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
* **Input:** Patient's medical pre conditions binomial data
* **Output:** Classification of requirement of ICU, and classification of chance of getting Covid based on Mortality

## [Amazon Price Tracker - Web Scraping](https://github.com/AbhijitGokhale/Amazon-Price-Tracker)
Recently there was an Amazon sale and I wanted to buy a product that I had been checking on for a long time. But, as I was ready to buy it I noticed that the price had increased and I wondered if the sale was even legitimate. So I figured by creating this price tracker app, it would not only increase my fluency in python but I would also have my very own home-brewed app to track amazon prices.
* **Python Libraries:** requests,BeautifulSoup, time, smtplib
* **Input:** Product URL, Sender and Receiver Email Adresses (one / many), Price Threshold value 
* **Output:** smtplib to trigger email with changed price amount
